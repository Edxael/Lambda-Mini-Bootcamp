     I,m enroll in a free Mni-BootCam by LambdaSchool

This school teaches using "Python" & "Flask"

However, I'm just a Beginner at programming and one person told me 
that when learning the first language I should focus on just one 
language, and not spread myself too thin. 

The language that I choose to learn One month ago is JavaScript, 
for that reason on this Mini-BootCamp I will do my work using 
JavaScrip and JavaScript technologies.  

I might learn Python and Flask in the future, but for now, I 
should focus on learning one language. 

Here is my Project of the Mini-BootCam by: LambdaSchool.  
using JavaScript and its technologies.
